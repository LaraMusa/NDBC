  <h1 id="t1">How It Works</h1>
  
  <p id="p">Each month we will choose one unputdownable, discussion-worthy novel or memoir, along with some intriguing discussion questions (which you don't have to answer). Don't like the book? Didn't finish it? No problem! Our comment section is a judgment-free zone.</p>

  <p id="p">In case you did enjoy the book you can discuss it with friends, leave a comment on the discussion page corresponding to the book you liked, or join our end of the month Zoom meeting. We look forward to hearing your thoughts!</p>
  
  <p id="p">Here you will find all of our book favorites (along with printable bookmarks, and themed recipes!). You may attain these books at the local book store (Stimatzki), or on Amazon (online retailer). Feel free to explore.</p>
  
  <p id="p">Head on readers!</p>

  <p id="p">Once upon a time, in a land blighted by terror, there was a very clever boy. The people thought the boy could save them, so they opened their gates and sent him out into the world. To where the monsters lived.</p>
